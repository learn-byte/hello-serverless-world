# What is Serverless?

### Serverless is a way to run code in the cloud without needing to provision or rent a full server.

Although the name suggests there isn't a server, it is a bit of a misnomer.  Your application's code is still run on a server in the cloud, however it doesn't require managing the server yourself or renting out a whole server just to run your application 24/7.

 We will use AWS Lambda to run our service only when the application is needed and is invoked by a user.  This will save us a lot of money.  Running AWS Lambda we are allotted 1 Million requests per month for free.  After that it will cost us a mere $0.20 per 1 million requests. Wow! üòç
