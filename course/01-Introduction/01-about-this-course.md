# Hello Serverless World!

#### In this lesson we will learn how to launch a serverless web app. The web app we build will have similar cloud based infrastructure to learn-byte.com and is a great starting template for building something big!

This course assumes basic prior programming knowledge.  We will teach: 

- Creating a serverless AWS Lambda
- Using Express in Lambdas for routing API requests
- Fetching Github user information
- Setting up Lambda for local development
- Building a React web client to receive all the data from our serverless lambda
- Launching it all onto Amazon Web Services for basically free!

This course has been designed for learners to be able to jump around to the parts they are interested in.  Feel free to dive into specific parts!

[Check out the working example](http://hello-serverless-world-client.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/) of what we will be building.
