# Initialize a Repository

## Where should we store all this lovely code we will write?

#### There are many different version control and code repository services but we will be using Github.

You probably already know about Github and already have an account but if you don't then spend some time [learning about Github here](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/introduction-to-github) and [get signed up for your account](https://github.com/join)!

### Once you're logged into your account [create a new Github Repository](https://github.com/new).

For this lambda service we we went with the name, `hello-world-serverless-lambda`. When we initialize our client repo we will call it `hello-world-serverless-client`. 

Add a description if you like, make it either public or private, and check "Initialize this repository with a README". 

Finally, from the dropdown add a .gitignore for Node, since we will be writing our Lambda using Express.js and Node.js.

Click `Create Repository`!

### Finally, let's get our repository cloned down to our local computer. 

Press the green "Clone or download" button and copy the "Clone with HTTPS" url from the popup.

Then in a terminal window navigate to a directory where you'd like to store the code, and clone it down!

`git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git`

`cd your-repo-name`

Initialize your package.json with this command:

`npm init`

Finish up by stepping through each question of npm init by providing details for your app.

Let's move on to the next step where we'll install Serverless! üêë
